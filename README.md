# FloorIsLava
FloorIsLava is minigame plugin for Bukkit/Spigot servers. It's similar to the traditional `Spleef` minigame. It features
a custom implemention that handles joining, breaking, and rewards differently.

29 July 2022 - Modified by Ryan Heuer (rmheuer) to use 1.8.8 Spigot API

## First Use
1. If you do not have the compiled plugin JAR file, compile this source using the Bukkit or Spigot API.
2. Place the JAR file in your Bukkit/Spigot Minecraft server's `plugins/` folder.
3. Start or restart your Bukkit/Spigot server.
4. The plugin will be loaded, but you will need to set up the config. 
5. Refer to the `config.yml` in this repository or the local copy created in `plugins/FloorIsLava/config.yml`.
6. Once you have your desired settings, run `/mfloor reload` to reload the configuration file. 
7. Verify anyone that should have permissions is given permissions with your permission handling plugin.

## Building

If on Windows: run `gradlew.bat build`

Otherwise: run `./gradlew build`

Result plugin JAR will be in `build/libs/FloorIsLava-VERSION.jar`

## Configuration
Refer to the [config.yml](https://github.com/GeeItsZee/FloorIsLava/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml) in this repository or a similarly commented file in your `plugins/FloorIsLava/config.yml`. Each setting is described and can be tuned as desired.
